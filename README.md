# React Static Job Listings

This is a simple React application that displays a list of static job listings. It was created as a learning project to explore some of the core concepts of React, such as component composition and state management using the Context API.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/oc-garcia/react-static-job-listings.git
```
Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view the application in your browser.
## Building for Production
